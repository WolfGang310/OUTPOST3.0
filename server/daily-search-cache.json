    "economicBrief": "The global economy is currently experiencing modest but uneven growth, projected at 3.0% for 2025, a slight deceleration from 2024. Despite this, overall market resilience is noted, with stock markets making progress amidst dramatic global political and economic events. Inflation, while trending down, remains above pre-pandemic levels in advanced economies. Major economies face varied conditions: the US shows dynamism with a cooling labor market, China grapples with a prolonged property downturn and demographic challenges, while India remains a strong performer. Global trade continues to face headwinds due to increased tensions and policy uncertainty. The Eurozone saw a slight acceleration in inflation in November, but it remains near target. Looking ahead to 2026, global growth is anticipated to stay just above 3%."
